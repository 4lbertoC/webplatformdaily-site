## What's coming next for this daily?

Next I'm implementing some sort of search functionality. So, you enter a term like "WebGL" and the entire database is filtered by that term.

## Is there an RSS feed?

Nope. It'll come eventually.

## When are new dailies released?

Dailies are released Monday to Saturday at around 8 am PT / 11 am ET / 5 pm CET.

## Where is the data stored?

In Markdown files, which makes it open source. You're free to use the data if you want to.

## What goes into creating a daily?

I gather the content from Twitter, i.e. from the tweets of the ~100 people I follow on Twitter. Usually, I select around 40-50 tweets (potential entries). Then, based on those tweets I create around 20-30 entries for the daily.

## What topics are covered?

 - Open Web Platform (i.e. the open standards that comprise it)
 - JavaScript
 - web-browsers (including their development tools)
 - front-end web-development 
 - open source to some degree (e.g. GitHub)

## How do you decide what goes into a daily?

I use my common sense.
